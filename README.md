My second gamedev project.

Mechanics:

- Move long the track;
- Rotate forwards and backwards;
- Ability to speed up;
- Finish line that restarts the level;
- Crash detection that restarts the level;
- Particle effects that play when touching the ground, when crashing, or when crossing the finsh line;
- Sound effects that are played when crashing, or when crossing the finish line;
